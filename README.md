# 🧠 Vision DL Architectures 🖼️

Welcome! 🚀 This repo is part of my journey to dive deep into **Deep Learning (DL)** for computer vision. It’s a personal project to document my learning journey to implement DL architectures from scratch. I’ll update it as I progress.

## 📚 About

This repository is a work in progress, where I:
- Explore and implement classic and SOTA DL architectures.
- Focus on understanding the inner workings of these models.
- Document my learning process and practical use cases.

## 🌟 Features

- **Implemented Architectures**:
  - CNNs: ResNet, VGG, etc.
  - Transformers: ViTs and variants.
  - Lightweight models: MobileNet, EfficientNet.
  - New approaches: Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt.

- **Flexible Training Framework**:
  - Pipelines for training and evaluation.
